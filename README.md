 This project was built with gradle and can be run using it as well

##### This project is a sample programmatic client for creating, viewing, and modifying loans.

### What youâ€™ll need to run it
+ OpenJDK 17 or later
+ Gradle

#### It can be run by using the ./gradlew build and then the ./gradlew run command in the root directory.

There is also a gradlew.bat script for windows users that should work in the same way, however it has not been tested.

### Improvements for the future
+ Add unit tests
+ Add proper error handling and validation

### There is a runnable main method located in the Client.java file.

This class will create, get, and update a loan and is a good example of how to use the client.
